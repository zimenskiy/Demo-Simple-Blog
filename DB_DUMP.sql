Physical media is dying for movies and games alike. Non-traditional market players like Apple and Google are just a heartbeat away from turning their widely deployed set-top boxes and televisions into serviceable casual gaming machines. And thanks to the advent of cloud gaming, it&#039;s not even clear that end users need their own hardware horsepower anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all going to play a big role in what the PlayStation 4 &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/28/2908673/playstation-orbis-ps4-rumor-amd-ps3-used-games&quot;&gt;codenamed &quot;Orbis&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; ultimately becomes. But at the end of the day, it&#039;s still a game console. And the games need to be good.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;THE GAMES&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;NO ONE HAS ANY IDEA WHAT NEXT-GEN IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s where the situation gets murky: no one actually has any idea what a &quot;next-generation&quot; video game is supposed to look like. In the past, PC games provided a blueprint for upcoming consoles; by the time Sony, Nintendo, and others needed to release new hardware, the PC was so far ahead that it was easy to see what was in store. That&#039;s simply not the case this time around, however. PC games certainly look much better than those available on seven- and eight-year-old console hardware today, but market realities mean that graphically intense AAA titles now must be created with consoles in mind. While PC titles run at sharper resolutions and smoother frame rates &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/game/crysis-3/2898&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;just called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Crysis 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;the best-looking game ever created &amp;mdash; they tend to be fundamentally the same game as what&#039;s offered on console. Compare to 2006, when the thought of playing something like&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on a PlayStation 2 would have been laughable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So, Sony has quite the challenge on its hand: the PlayStation 4 can&#039;t simply display graphics on the level of current PC games. Releases will have to look&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;than those games, otherwise customers will quite reasonably ask why the same title couldn&#039;t run on a PlayStation 3 without the need for an expensive new console.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2189919/wd-noscale.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Wd-noscale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What about launch titles? One name often mentioned is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/2012/6/4/3063955/what-is-ubisofts-watch-dogs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a title shown off by Ubisoft at last year&#039;s E3 and apparently set for &quot;all home consoles&quot; this holiday season. It looks impressive enough that we wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see it significantly pared down for current-gen systems, with a full version coming to the PS4 and its next-gen Xbox counterpart. The same goes for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/1/3285891/watch-this-first-gameplay-of-metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which developer Kojima Productions insists was demoed on PC hardware equivalent to a PS3, but looks suspiciously high-fidelity to us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/17/3998378/bungie-destiny-console-shooter-revealed&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new game from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;creators Bungie, is also rumored to make its way to next-generation platforms. An outside bet is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/13/2632741/sony-fumito-ueda-last-guardian-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the developers of PS2 classics&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ico&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;. In development for several years with little in the way of results to show for it, original director Fumito Ueda&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fumi.to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted an update&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;last week to say that more would be revealed soon. Could it have been shifted from PlayStation 3 to 4? The same thing happened to&lt;em&gt;Ico&lt;/em&gt;, which started development as a PS One title, so we&#039;re ruling nothing out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;IS THIS THE END FOR THE USED GAME MARKET?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One potentially controversial feature pertains to used game support &amp;mdash; or the lack thereof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s initial Orbis report suggested that the new console would&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/news/sony-patents-tech-to-block-used-games-6401992&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lock discs to PlayStation Network accounts&lt;/a&gt;, nullifying the ability to sell games on to another player. Similar reports have floated around for Microsoft&#039;s next-gen console;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/25/2733083/next-xbox-bringing-blu-ray-drive-kinect-2-and-anti-used-game-system/in/2495929&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as much over a year ago, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3958672/new-xbox-always-online-game-activation-codes-rumor&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;said the same thing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;earlier this month. When Sony&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/news/sony-patents-tech-to-block-used-games-6401992&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;filed a patent application&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for just such a DRM scheme, it caused additional furor. However,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;believes that the PlayStation 4 will not block used games, potentially setting up a significant distinction between the two consoles in the eyes of both publishers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/1/2836595/gamestop-ceo-sony-and-microsoft-could-have-cut-us-off-a-long-time-ago&quot;&gt;and retailers&lt;/a&gt;. It would certainly be a risky move for one manufacturer to go it alone with such a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;THE CONTROLLER: A GATEWAY TO SOCIAL NETWORKING?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As with every console, the PS4&#039;s controller is an area of intense speculation &amp;mdash; you hold it for hours on end, so it needs to be good. An alleged photo of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/14/3989566/sony-playstation-4-controller-prototype-reportedly-leaked-in-new-photo/in/3706183&quot;&gt;prototype PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;leaked out last week; it looks to keep the same basic layout and shape that Sony has used since the original PlayStation, but with some fresh twists.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The center of the controller is dominated by a PS Vita-style touchpad, which could offer an additional form of analog input next to the traditional sticks. A blue light at the top looks like it may handle PlayStation Move-style pointing functionality, though we can&#039;t see the controller itself working too well as a tennis racket substitute in motion games &amp;mdash; nor is Sony likely to push gyroscopic motion control as a major feature, given the failure of PS3 titles such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lair&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that relied on the similar Sixaxis sensors. Other changes include what appears to be a headphone jack on the bottom, a speaker below the touchpad, and longer handles that are reminiscent of the first PlayStation&#039;s original analog controller before the addition of rumble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5985356/source-the-ps4-will-be-out-this-november-and-youll-be-able-to-control-it-with-your-phone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reports&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that every PlayStation 4 will come with the PS Eye camera needed for Sony&#039;s brand of motion control.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2168477/playstation_4_controller_leak_destructoid_640.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Playstation_4_controller_leak_destructoid_640&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The controller prototype has another unlabeled button of no obvious function, but it could well tie into the PlayStation 4&#039;s social media capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/1/3940986/next-playstation-will-have-a-redesigned-controller-launch-by-christmas-says-report/in/3706183&quot;&gt;According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the PS4 controller will feature a dedicated &quot;Share&quot; button that allows players to post screenshots and videos to various social networks, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reported yesterday that Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube will factor prominently. If&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s source is to be believed, the PS4 constantly records gameplay with no processing penalty, and at any point the last 15 minutes of footage can be edited and posted online. This sounds like a fantastic idea, if one we&#039;ve heard before: the ill-fated OnLive streaming game service&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/23/2814926/onlive-universal-wireless-controller-review&quot;&gt;let you push a button to capture the last ten seconds of gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, and it led to a collection of hilarious videos of gaming accomplishments. It&#039;s a neat way for players to get involved with their games, and would guarantee a source of viral, word-of-mouth marketing with next to no effort on Sony&#039;s part.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;THE CLOUD TAKES A STARRING ROLE&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/7/2/3131408/sony-computer-entertainment-buys-gaikai-for-380-million&quot;&gt;Sony&#039;s acquisition of Gaikai&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;last year, it&#039;s reasonable to assume that cloud gaming will form part of the PlayStation 4 strategy, and just today we got word of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4006310/gaikai-domain-registrations-point-to-new-sony-playstation-cloud-service&quot;&gt;possible service called PlayStation Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;through some leaked domain registrations. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Gaikai technology will be used to provide backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 3; players will be able to stream games online from Sony&#039;s servers. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s report doesn&#039;t cite any other examples, but there are many possibilities for where Sony could take the service. Saving games to the cloud is a given, as it&#039;s already implemented on the PlayStation Plus service for PS3 and Vita, but a cloud gaming service could save the exact state of your game. Could Sony allow you the possibility to finish playing a game on the couch, and immediately pick up where you left off by using a Vita?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1150189/IMG_5049.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Img_5049&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s sources also say that Sony may support multiplayer gameplay across devices, for example between a smartphone and a console, and this could benefit greatly from cloud gaming. Right now, gamers can play against friends on console using a handheld device, but only when the games have been built explicitly with that in mind, and aren&#039;t too graphically intensive for a handheld to run. With Gaikai, this could become a standard feature: you could theoretically play the exact same game on any system, because neither would be running on the actual hardware in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But beyond the Gaikai rumors and vague rumblings about social sharing, the online capabilities of the PlayStation 4 are an unknown quantity. The PlayStation 3&#039;s connected features have been overhauled so dramatically over the console&#039;s lifespan that the system is barely recognizable today, so its successor will have a fairly solid baseline to work from. The usual array of streaming video apps and Sony&#039;s own media services are a given, as is gaming functionality via the PlayStation Network, but there&#039;s little indication of how the company might attempt to improve on the PS3 as a connected media box. Xbox Live still provides the more advanced online gaming experience in a few key areas, too, and Sony will likely look to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1164078/PSplus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Psplus&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;ll be interesting to see what the company does with PlayStation Plus in the next generation; the service has grown into an excellent value addition to the PlayStation platform, offering a steady stream of free and discounted games for about the same price as an Xbox Live Gold subscription. A lot of people are happy to pay for Xbox Live, though, so Sony may well be tempted to try and secure more subscribers this time around &amp;mdash; either by boosting PlayStation Plus benefits or following Microsoft&#039;s lead by putting console features (like online multiplayer) behind a paywall. Sources already say that might be the case. It might make sense to restrict cloud services to paid customers, and the current incarnation of PlayStation Plus already has some features in this vein such as automatic software updates and online savegames.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;PS VITA&#039;S SECOND CHANCE?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THE NEXT PLAYSTATION COULD PROVIDE A SHOT IN THE ARM TO THE PS VITA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Vita, the next PlayStation could provide a shot in the arm to Sony&#039;s portable in a few ways. Besides the possibility of streaming full console games to the Vita over the cloud, there&#039;s a lot of scope for what it could do over a local connection in the living room, too. The obvious example is Wii U-style second screen functionality &amp;mdash; there&#039;s no reason why Sony couldn&#039;t get the two systems to talk to each other in the same way, and some PS3 games such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet 2&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have already experimented with using the Vita as a controller. It&#039;s unlikely many users would buy a $250 portable console expressly for that purpose, but with SmartGlass already a part of Microsoft&#039;s current-generation strategy, it seems a sure thing that Sony will announce some sort of second screen feature for the new PlayStation. If not the Vita, then perhaps your smartphone will be able to control the system,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5985356/source-the-ps4-will-be-out-this-november-and-youll-be-able-to-control-it-with-your-phone&quot;&gt;as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. (Incidentally, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/18/4000306/ps-vita-price-cut-japan&quot;&gt;Vita received a 20 percent price cut&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Japan this week, and Sony could well announce a similar drop for the US at tomorrow&#039;s event.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;ANOTHER BATTLE WITH MICROSOFT FOR NEXT-GEN SUPREMACY&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nintendo doesn&#039;t play the specs game. For musclebound Sony and Microsoft, though, it&#039;s an unavoidable clash with every new generation of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s well-regarded&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog reported a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-orbis-unmasked-what-to-expect-from-next-gen-console&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comprehensive rundown&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Orbis hardware a month ago, claiming that it would pair a 1.6GHz eight-core AMD processor with Radeon HD graphics hardware. The processor is said to be based on AMD&#039;s low-power Jaguar architecture, and will reportedly make an appearance in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/25/2731888/next-xbox&quot;&gt;Microsoft&#039;s next-gen console&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; widely known as &quot;Durango&quot; internally &amp;mdash; as well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2191411/microsoft-xbox-controller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft-xbox-controller&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;SONY MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER MICROSOFT IN PURE GAMING PERFORMANCE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So how powerful will the PS4 actually be, and how will it compare to Durango?&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pitted the two hypothetical consoles&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-spec-analysis-durango-vs-orbis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;against each other&lt;/a&gt;, and found that Orbis &quot;looks the tighter, more powerful, more games-focused design&quot; thanks to a beefier GPU and faster RAM. Clearly, that comparison is based on a lot of hypotheticals, unknowns, leaks, and rumors, but it&#039;s something to get the warring factions started early. Regardless, it&#039;s safe to say that both will easily outclass the Wii U in raw performance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;NOW IT&#039;S TIME FOR SONY TO EXECUTE&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The two most important figures for many &amp;mdash; price, and release date &amp;mdash; probably won&#039;t be revealed this week. There&#039;s almost a full year to go before the suggested holiday launch, and a lot of things can change in that time &amp;mdash; not least Microsoft&#039;s own entry. A late 2013 release in North America and Japan seems a safe bet, based on history and reports;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have both reported as much (the PlayStation 3 slipped to a spring 2007 release date in Europe following a holiday 2006 launch elsewhere), and&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;suggests a November launch. And according to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;the system will launch for over 40,000 yen in Japan, which if true would suggest a US price of at least $399.99 even with the most optimistic exchange rate interpretation.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5985356/source-the-ps4-will-be-out-this-november-and-youll-be-able-to-control-it-with-your-phone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;says&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;there will actually be two models, tentatively priced at $429.99 and $529.99 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re unlikely to learn absolutely everything about the PlayStation 4 tomorrow, then, but at this stage one thing&#039;s for sure: Sony&#039;s banking on this product &amp;mdash; and the entire ecosystem that will congeal around it &amp;mdash; to spearhead the Japanese giant&#039;s turnaround. The execution will need to be flawless for Sony&#039;s ambitions to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister, Andrew Webster, and Chris Ziegler contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1361279082, 1, 1),

But while Spotify has amassed a following of 5 million paying subscribers and 20 million total users worldwide, its business model is still unproven.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;70 PERCENT OF SPOTIFY&#039;S REVENUE GOES TO LICENSING FEES&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;About 70 percent of Spotify&amp;rsquo;s revenues pays music-licensing fees while another 20 percent covers customer acquisition, these sources said. That leaves 10 percent to pay all of the company&amp;rsquo;s other costs, including its much praised technology platform. Insiders have told&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that this cost structure zeroes out Spotify&amp;rsquo;s profits.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any attempts to plead poverty by Spotify are likely to be met with skepticism by the recording industry. For years, music acts have reported receiving far skimpier royalty checks from Spotify than from other music services, such as iTunes. Some acts, including Coldplay, Adele, and Taylor Swift, have refused to distribute their songs through Spotify and other subscription services. Meanwhile, Spotify raised $100 million last year in its latest funding round. If artists bail on Spotify, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what cuts labels might be willing to accept. Everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;IF ARTISTS BAIL, EVERYONE LOSES&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Record company executives have heard for a decade that they need to cut prices. The industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be willing to give much ground. Internet radio service Pandora is lobbying Congress to lower its statutory rates for playing songs. The record companies are spending big to thwart the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The record companies have plenty of digital music alternatives to Spotify. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Sony are all companies with very deep pockets who sell music at razor-thin margins or even at a loss. To these companies, music is just one of the ways that they sex up their other businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;SPOTIFY WANTS LABELS TO EXPAND ITS FREE TRIAL FOR MOBILE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Simple rate renegotiation isn&amp;rsquo;t the only thing on the table. According to sources, Spotify is also trying to convince the labels to extend its ad-supported free tier for mobile devices, offering &quot;more of a taste&quot; than the current 30 day trial. Restricting mobile to paying or pro subscribers limits both the total number of Spotify customers and their overall usage. But it&amp;rsquo;s a risky bet. Without access to mobile music as an incentive, will users continue to convert from ad-supported to paid subscriptions? Or is it users&amp;rsquo; inability to see the value of Spotify on mobile that makes them less likely to buy in?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;BROAD TRENDS ALL FAVOR SPOTIFY&#039;S MODEL&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Spotify is still in a good negotiating position. Apple remains the leader in online music distribution but overall, sales of music downloads have slowed to a trickle. Downloads just aren&#039;t making up for the decline in CD sales. We keep hearing that Apple is going to launch a subscription radio service similar to Pandora, but music industry sources say Apple and the labels are still far apart on licensing. As for Google and the others, their music offerings have yet to ignite much interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad trends all favor subscription streaming on a wide range of devices, and Spotify is the only subscription service that has generated real scale. The labels are big fans of the subscription model, which gives them predictable income across their entire catalog. The major labels have a vested interest in making sure subscription-based music continues to grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Also in Spotify&amp;rsquo;s favor: in some markets, the company is close to converting 20 percent of its users of the free service to a paid plan, sources said. If Spotify can parlay its current pole position into more favorable rates, it may be able to retain its lead even as giants like Amazon and Apple come nipping at its heels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&quot;EVERYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO SEE SPOTIFY SUCCEED.&quot;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s unclear exactly how far the two sides are willing to bend, It&amp;rsquo;s inconceivable that the labels or Spotify would walk away without a deal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everybody in the industry wants to see Spotify succeed,&quot; one industry insider told&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Nobody in the industry can afford to see them go down the tubes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Carmody and Ben Popper contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1361340163, 1, 1),

The recently launched Kickstarter project is a retelling of the classic folklore tale, in which players take on the role of the Golem as they attempt to protect the city of Prague. It&#039;s a big project that&#039;s very different from what Moonbot is known for, but the studio sees it as more of an extension of what they&#039;ve done in the past. &quot;Games are fun,&quot; says creative partner William Joyce, &quot;and we like to have fun.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;column grid_12&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;snippet review-snippet4 clearfix&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;sset clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;entry-section-title&quot; name=&quot;section_4&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;column grid_4&quot;&gt;&quot;IT&#039;S LIKE EXPERIENCING BABYHOOD.

To defend themselves, the five guilds of Prague join together to construct a massive human-like creature capable of defending their home. Joyce initially stumbled across the concept through classic film versions of the golem tale, and became especially enamored when reading Michael Chabon&#039;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp;amp; Clay&lt;/em&gt;. As it turned out, Chabon and Joyce lived near one another &amp;mdash; Chabon&#039;s kids even enjoyed the animated series&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Rolie Polie Olie&lt;/em&gt;, which Joyce helped create. As the two became friends, Joyce discovered just how many versions of the tale there were, and the story continued to fascinate him.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&#039;s sort of like the first monster movie,&quot; he explains. &quot;It seems like&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt;, all of these monster films about man creating something came from this first story,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;.&quot; Moonbot began working on golem-related stories, doing plenty of research and writing, and even visiting Prague where they &quot;soaked up the atmosphere.&quot; But the project wasn&#039;t always destined to be a game. It started out as a novel and then became a film, but around that time the studio was also thinking about doing a longer-form game experience to follow&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Diggs Nightcrawler&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;, it turned out, was a perfect fit.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;What I think is special about&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a game is how the journey of the protagonist mirrors things we take for granted in games,&quot; explains creative director Adam Volker. &quot;So as the player learns the system, which people do in every game that they play, the Golem is learning to be whoever he&#039;s going to be.&quot; Since the Golem has just been created, this learning includes fundamental things like moving your arms and legs, as well as the more advanced mechanics needed to defend the city. &quot;It&#039;s like experiencing babyhood,&quot; says Joyce. &quot;Except you&#039;re a giant baby.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;snippet feature-snippet feature-snippet5 clearfix&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;snimage snimage-1020&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2153323/still_01_redone.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Still_01_redone&quot; width=&quot;500&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;snippet feature-snippet feature-snippet7 clearfix&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;sset clearfix&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;column grid_6&quot;&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;This convergence of narrative and game mechanics is key to what Moonbot wants to do with games &amp;mdash; that is, using the medium as a new way to tell stories. The studio has already been successful telling stories through books and movies, but it views games as &quot;a new kind of storytelling&quot; &amp;mdash; and one it&#039;s eager to be a part of. &quot;I think our priorities might be a little different than your average game developer. Lots of people like to use the word story, but what that means to us specifically might be different,&quot; says Volker, describing&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s blending of story and gameplay. Over the course of Golem&amp;rsquo;s quest &amp;mdash; which, like Data and the Tinman before him, includes the desire for a human soul &amp;mdash; you&amp;rsquo;ll feel the same joys and frustrations, since you&amp;rsquo;re literally learning alongside the character.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;At least that&amp;rsquo;s what Moonbot hopes: few games have been able to evoke the kind of emotion that the team is aiming for with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;. Joyce cites&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as an example of an emotionally fulfilling game experience, but unlike&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journey&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;developer thatgamecompany, Moonbot doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a history of creating these kinds of arresting moments in games. This could be part of the reason the Kickstarter has failed to catch on quite the way the studio hoped &amp;mdash; it&amp;rsquo;s an ambitious project from a company few gamers have heard of. As of this writing&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;has managed to raise more than $37,000, a far cry from its $750,000 goal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The studio decided to utilize crowdfunding as a way of keeping development independent, thus avoiding the bureaucratic delays and red tape that can go along with working with a publisher &amp;mdash; something Moonbot has dealt with in the past working within Hollywood&amp;rsquo;s studio structure. If all goes well, the game is slated to launch in 2015 on Windows, Mac, and Linux. In spite of the slow start, though, the company hopes that its lack of game development experience won&amp;rsquo;t deter backers. In fact, it might actually be a good thing.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My entire career has been about doing things you&#039;re not supposed to do.&amp;rdquo; says Joyce. &amp;ldquo;There&#039;s a theory that the inspired amateur can sometimes break new ground and do amazing stuff that nobody thought of. So it&#039;s like, let&#039;s do a giant game and make people cry and make people really care. And everybody is like &#039;but you haven&#039;t done this before!&#039; and I&#039;m like &#039;so fucking what!&#039; We pick things that we haven&#039;t done before and we do pretty good.

We just love what we do and we&#039;re devoted to getting it right and we don&#039;t stop until we do.&amp;rdquo; And that&amp;rsquo;s true even if&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Golem&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;doesn&amp;rsquo;t get funded, he says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;We&#039;re going to go for it no matter what.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div class=&quot;column grid_4&quot;&gt;&amp;ldquo;MY ENTIRE CAREER HAS BEEN ABOUT DOING THINGS YOU&#039;RE NOT SUPPOSED TO DO.&amp;rdquo;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2153363/golem_sketching44_300.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Golem_sketching44_300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;/div&gt;', 1361343445, 1, 9),

But while Spotify has amassed a following of 5 million paying subscribers and 20 million total users worldwide, its business model is still unproven.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;70 PERCENT OF SPOTIFY&#039;S REVENUE GOES TO LICENSING FEES&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;About 70 percent of Spotify&amp;rsquo;s revenues pays music-licensing fees while another 20 percent covers customer acquisition, these sources said. That leaves 10 percent to pay all of the company&amp;rsquo;s other costs, including its much praised technology platform. Insiders have told&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that this cost structure zeroes out Spotify&amp;rsquo;s profits.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Any attempts to plead poverty by Spotify are likely to be met with skepticism by the recording industry. For years, music acts have reported receiving far skimpier royalty checks from Spotify than from other music services, such as iTunes. Some acts, including Coldplay, Adele, and Taylor Swift, have refused to distribute their songs through Spotify and other subscription services. Meanwhile, Spotify raised $100 million last year in its latest funding round. If artists bail on Spotify, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what cuts labels might be willing to accept. Everyone loses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;IF ARTISTS BAIL, EVERYONE LOSES&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Record company executives have heard for a decade that they need to cut prices. The industry doesn&amp;rsquo;t appear to be willing to give much ground. Internet radio service Pandora is lobbying Congress to lower its statutory rates for playing songs. The record companies are spending big to thwart the attempt.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The record companies have plenty of digital music alternatives to Spotify. Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Sony are all companies with very deep pockets who sell music at razor-thin margins or even at a loss. To these companies, music is just one of the ways that they sex up their other businesses.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;SPOTIFY WANTS LABELS TO EXPAND ITS FREE TRIAL FOR MOBILE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Simple rate renegotiation isn&amp;rsquo;t the only thing on the table. According to sources, Spotify is also trying to convince the labels to extend its ad-supported free tier for mobile devices, offering &quot;more of a taste&quot; than the current 30 day trial. Restricting mobile to paying or pro subscribers limits both the total number of Spotify customers and their overall usage. But it&amp;rsquo;s a risky bet. Without access to mobile music as an incentive, will users continue to convert from ad-supported to paid subscriptions? Or is it users&amp;rsquo; inability to see the value of Spotify on mobile that makes them less likely to buy in?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;BROAD TRENDS ALL FAVOR SPOTIFY&#039;S MODEL&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Spotify is still in a good negotiating position. Apple remains the leader in online music distribution but overall, sales of music downloads have slowed to a trickle. Downloads just aren&#039;t making up for the decline in CD sales. We keep hearing that Apple is going to launch a subscription radio service similar to Pandora, but music industry sources say Apple and the labels are still far apart on licensing. As for Google and the others, their music offerings have yet to ignite much interest.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The broad trends all favor subscription streaming on a wide range of devices, and Spotify is the only subscription service that has generated real scale. The labels are big fans of the subscription model, which gives them predictable income across their entire catalog. The major labels have a vested interest in making sure subscription-based music continues to grow and thrive.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Also in Spotify&amp;rsquo;s favor: in some markets, the company is close to converting 20 percent of its users of the free service to a paid plan, sources said. If Spotify can parlay its current pole position into more favorable rates, it may be able to retain its lead even as giants like Amazon and Apple come nipping at its heels.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&quot;EVERYBODY IN THE INDUSTRY WANTS TO SEE SPOTIFY SUCCEED.&quot;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s unclear exactly how far the two sides are willing to bend, It&amp;rsquo;s inconceivable that the labels or Spotify would walk away without a deal.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Everybody in the industry wants to see Spotify succeed,&quot; one industry insider told&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &quot;Nobody in the industry can afford to see them go down the tubes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tim Carmody and Ben Popper contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1361340163, 1, 1),

Physical media is dying for movies and games alike. Non-traditional market players like Apple and Google are just a heartbeat away from turning their widely deployed set-top boxes and televisions into serviceable casual gaming machines. And thanks to the advent of cloud gaming, it&#039;s not even clear that end users need their own hardware horsepower anymore.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all going to play a big role in what the PlayStation 4 &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/28/2908673/playstation-orbis-ps4-rumor-amd-ps3-used-games&quot;&gt;codenamed &quot;Orbis&quot;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; ultimately becomes. But at the end of the day, it&#039;s still a game console. And the games need to be good.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;THE GAMES&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;NO ONE HAS ANY IDEA WHAT NEXT-GEN IS SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Here&#039;s where the situation gets murky: no one actually has any idea what a &quot;next-generation&quot; video game is supposed to look like. In the past, PC games provided a blueprint for upcoming consoles; by the time Sony, Nintendo, and others needed to release new hardware, the PC was so far ahead that it was easy to see what was in store. That&#039;s simply not the case this time around, however. PC games certainly look much better than those available on seven- and eight-year-old console hardware today, but market realities mean that graphically intense AAA titles now must be created with consoles in mind. While PC titles run at sharper resolutions and smoother frame rates &amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/game/crysis-3/2898&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;just called&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Crysis 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;the best-looking game ever created &amp;mdash; they tend to be fundamentally the same game as what&#039;s offered on console. Compare to 2006, when the thought of playing something like&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on a PlayStation 2 would have been laughable.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So, Sony has quite the challenge on its hand: the PlayStation 4 can&#039;t simply display graphics on the level of current PC games. Releases will have to look&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;than those games, otherwise customers will quite reasonably ask why the same title couldn&#039;t run on a PlayStation 3 without the need for an expensive new console.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2189919/wd-noscale.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;Wd-noscale&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;What about launch titles? One name often mentioned is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/2012/6/4/3063955/what-is-ubisofts-watch-dogs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a title shown off by Ubisoft at last year&#039;s E3 and apparently set for &quot;all home consoles&quot; this holiday season. It looks impressive enough that we wouldn&#039;t be surprised to see it significantly pared down for current-gen systems, with a full version coming to the PS4 and its next-gen Xbox counterpart. The same goes for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/1/3285891/watch-this-first-gameplay-of-metal-gear-solid-ground-zeroes&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which developer Kojima Productions insists was demoed on PC hardware equivalent to a PS3, but looks suspiciously high-fidelity to us.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/17/3998378/bungie-destiny-console-shooter-revealed&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the new game from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;creators Bungie, is also rumored to make its way to next-generation platforms. An outside bet is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/13/2632741/sony-fumito-ueda-last-guardian-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the developers of PS2 classics&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Ico&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;. In development for several years with little in the way of results to show for it, original director Fumito Ueda&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fumi.to/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;posted an update&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;last week to say that more would be revealed soon. Could it have been shifted from PlayStation 3 to 4? The same thing happened to&lt;em&gt;Ico&lt;/em&gt;, which started development as a PS One title, so we&#039;re ruling nothing out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;IS THIS THE END FOR THE USED GAME MARKET?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;One potentially controversial feature pertains to used game support &amp;mdash; or the lack thereof.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s initial Orbis report suggested that the new console would&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/news/sony-patents-tech-to-block-used-games-6401992&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lock discs to PlayStation Network accounts&lt;/a&gt;, nullifying the ability to sell games on to another player. Similar reports have floated around for Microsoft&#039;s next-gen console;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/25/2733083/next-xbox-bringing-blu-ray-drive-kinect-2-and-anti-used-game-system/in/2495929&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as much over a year ago, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/6/3958672/new-xbox-always-online-game-activation-codes-rumor&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;said the same thing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;earlier this month. When Sony&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gamespot.com/news/sony-patents-tech-to-block-used-games-6401992&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;filed a patent application&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for just such a DRM scheme, it caused additional furor. However,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;believes that the PlayStation 4 will not block used games, potentially setting up a significant distinction between the two consoles in the eyes of both publishers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/3/1/2836595/gamestop-ceo-sony-and-microsoft-could-have-cut-us-off-a-long-time-ago&quot;&gt;and retailers&lt;/a&gt;. It would certainly be a risky move for one manufacturer to go it alone with such a strategy.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;THE CONTROLLER: A GATEWAY TO SOCIAL NETWORKING?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;As with every console, the PS4&#039;s controller is an area of intense speculation &amp;mdash; you hold it for hours on end, so it needs to be good. An alleged photo of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/14/3989566/sony-playstation-4-controller-prototype-reportedly-leaked-in-new-photo/in/3706183&quot;&gt;prototype PS4 pad&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;leaked out last week; it looks to keep the same basic layout and shape that Sony has used since the original PlayStation, but with some fresh twists.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The center of the controller is dominated by a PS Vita-style touchpad, which could offer an additional form of analog input next to the traditional sticks. A blue light at the top looks like it may handle PlayStation Move-style pointing functionality, though we can&#039;t see the controller itself working too well as a tennis racket substitute in motion games &amp;mdash; nor is Sony likely to push gyroscopic motion control as a major feature, given the failure of PS3 titles such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lair&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that relied on the similar Sixaxis sensors. Other changes include what appears to be a headphone jack on the bottom, a speaker below the touchpad, and longer handles that are reminiscent of the first PlayStation&#039;s original analog controller before the addition of rumble.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5985356/source-the-ps4-will-be-out-this-november-and-youll-be-able-to-control-it-with-your-phone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reports&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that every PlayStation 4 will come with the PS Eye camera needed for Sony&#039;s brand of motion control.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2168477/playstation_4_controller_leak_destructoid_640.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Playstation_4_controller_leak_destructoid_640&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The controller prototype has another unlabeled button of no obvious function, but it could well tie into the PlayStation 4&#039;s social media capabilities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/1/3940986/next-playstation-will-have-a-redesigned-controller-launch-by-christmas-says-report/in/3706183&quot;&gt;According to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the PS4 controller will feature a dedicated &quot;Share&quot; button that allows players to post screenshots and videos to various social networks, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;reported yesterday that Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube will factor prominently. If&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s source is to be believed, the PS4 constantly records gameplay with no processing penalty, and at any point the last 15 minutes of footage can be edited and posted online. This sounds like a fantastic idea, if one we&#039;ve heard before: the ill-fated OnLive streaming game service&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/2/23/2814926/onlive-universal-wireless-controller-review&quot;&gt;let you push a button to capture the last ten seconds of gameplay&lt;/a&gt;, and it led to a collection of hilarious videos of gaming accomplishments. It&#039;s a neat way for players to get involved with their games, and would guarantee a source of viral, word-of-mouth marketing with next to no effort on Sony&#039;s part.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;THE CLOUD TAKES A STARRING ROLE&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;With&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/7/2/3131408/sony-computer-entertainment-buys-gaikai-for-380-million&quot;&gt;Sony&#039;s acquisition of Gaikai&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;last year, it&#039;s reasonable to assume that cloud gaming will form part of the PlayStation 4 strategy, and just today we got word of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/19/4006310/gaikai-domain-registrations-point-to-new-sony-playstation-cloud-service&quot;&gt;possible service called PlayStation Cloud&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;through some leaked domain registrations. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Gaikai technology will be used to provide backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 3; players will be able to stream games online from Sony&#039;s servers. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s report doesn&#039;t cite any other examples, but there are many possibilities for where Sony could take the service. Saving games to the cloud is a given, as it&#039;s already implemented on the PlayStation Plus service for PS3 and Vita, but a cloud gaming service could save the exact state of your game. Could Sony allow you the possibility to finish playing a game on the couch, and immediately pick up where you left off by using a Vita?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1150189/IMG_5049.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Img_5049&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Similarly, The&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s sources also say that Sony may support multiplayer gameplay across devices, for example between a smartphone and a console, and this could benefit greatly from cloud gaming. Right now, gamers can play against friends on console using a handheld device, but only when the games have been built explicitly with that in mind, and aren&#039;t too graphically intensive for a handheld to run. With Gaikai, this could become a standard feature: you could theoretically play the exact same game on any system, because neither would be running on the actual hardware in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;But beyond the Gaikai rumors and vague rumblings about social sharing, the online capabilities of the PlayStation 4 are an unknown quantity. The PlayStation 3&#039;s connected features have been overhauled so dramatically over the console&#039;s lifespan that the system is barely recognizable today, so its successor will have a fairly solid baseline to work from. The usual array of streaming video apps and Sony&#039;s own media services are a given, as is gaming functionality via the PlayStation Network, but there&#039;s little indication of how the company might attempt to improve on the PS3 as a connected media box. Xbox Live still provides the more advanced online gaming experience in a few key areas, too, and Sony will likely look to close the gap.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1164078/PSplus.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Psplus&quot; width=&quot;560&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;It&#039;ll be interesting to see what the company does with PlayStation Plus in the next generation; the service has grown into an excellent value addition to the PlayStation platform, offering a steady stream of free and discounted games for about the same price as an Xbox Live Gold subscription. A lot of people are happy to pay for Xbox Live, though, so Sony may well be tempted to try and secure more subscribers this time around &amp;mdash; either by boosting PlayStation Plus benefits or following Microsoft&#039;s lead by putting console features (like online multiplayer) behind a paywall. Sources already say that might be the case. It might make sense to restrict cloud services to paid customers, and the current incarnation of PlayStation Plus already has some features in this vein such as automatic software updates and online savegames.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;PS VITA&#039;S SECOND CHANCE?&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;left&quot;&gt;THE NEXT PLAYSTATION COULD PROVIDE A SHOT IN THE ARM TO THE PS VITA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the Vita, the next PlayStation could provide a shot in the arm to Sony&#039;s portable in a few ways. Besides the possibility of streaming full console games to the Vita over the cloud, there&#039;s a lot of scope for what it could do over a local connection in the living room, too. The obvious example is Wii U-style second screen functionality &amp;mdash; there&#039;s no reason why Sony couldn&#039;t get the two systems to talk to each other in the same way, and some PS3 games such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;LittleBigPlanet 2&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have already experimented with using the Vita as a controller. It&#039;s unlikely many users would buy a $250 portable console expressly for that purpose, but with SmartGlass already a part of Microsoft&#039;s current-generation strategy, it seems a sure thing that Sony will announce some sort of second screen feature for the new PlayStation. If not the Vita, then perhaps your smartphone will be able to control the system,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5985356/source-the-ps4-will-be-out-this-november-and-youll-be-able-to-control-it-with-your-phone&quot;&gt;as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;. (Incidentally, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/2/18/4000306/ps-vita-price-cut-japan&quot;&gt;Vita received a 20 percent price cut&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Japan this week, and Sony could well announce a similar drop for the US at tomorrow&#039;s event.)&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;ANOTHER BATTLE WITH MICROSOFT FOR NEXT-GEN SUPREMACY&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nintendo doesn&#039;t play the specs game. For musclebound Sony and Microsoft, though, it&#039;s an unavoidable clash with every new generation of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&#039;s well-regarded&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;blog reported a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-orbis-unmasked-what-to-expect-from-next-gen-console&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;comprehensive rundown&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the Orbis hardware a month ago, claiming that it would pair a 1.6GHz eight-core AMD processor with Radeon HD graphics hardware. The processor is said to be based on AMD&#039;s low-power Jaguar architecture, and will reportedly make an appearance in&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2012/1/25/2731888/next-xbox&quot;&gt;Microsoft&#039;s next-gen console&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; widely known as &quot;Durango&quot; internally &amp;mdash; as well.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;photo&quot; src=&quot;http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/2191411/microsoft-xbox-controller.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Microsoft-xbox-controller&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;q class=&quot;right&quot;&gt;SONY MAY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OVER MICROSOFT IN PURE GAMING PERFORMANCE&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;So how powerful will the PS4 actually be, and how will it compare to Durango?&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Digital Foundry&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pitted the two hypothetical consoles&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/df-hardware-spec-analysis-durango-vs-orbis&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;against each other&lt;/a&gt;, and found that Orbis &quot;looks the tighter, more powerful, more games-focused design&quot; thanks to a beefier GPU and faster RAM. Clearly, that comparison is based on a lot of hypotheticals, unknowns, leaks, and rumors, but it&#039;s something to get the warring factions started early. Regardless, it&#039;s safe to say that both will easily outclass the Wii U in raw performance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;h2&gt;NOW IT&#039;S TIME FOR SONY TO EXECUTE&lt;/h2&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;The two most important figures for many &amp;mdash; price, and release date &amp;mdash; probably won&#039;t be revealed this week. There&#039;s almost a full year to go before the suggested holiday launch, and a lot of things can change in that time &amp;mdash; not least Microsoft&#039;s own entry. A late 2013 release in North America and Japan seems a safe bet, based on history and reports;&lt;em&gt;Edge&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have both reported as much (the PlayStation 3 slipped to a spring 2007 release date in Europe following a holiday 2006 launch elsewhere), and&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;suggests a November launch. And according to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Asahi Shimbun&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;the system will launch for over 40,000 yen in Japan, which if true would suggest a US price of at least $399.99 even with the most optimistic exchange rate interpretation.&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://kotaku.com/5985356/source-the-ps4-will-be-out-this-november-and-youll-be-able-to-control-it-with-your-phone&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;says&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;there will actually be two models, tentatively priced at $429.99 and $529.99 respectively.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re unlikely to learn absolutely everything about the PlayStation 4 tomorrow, then, but at this stage one thing&#039;s for sure: Sony&#039;s banking on this product &amp;mdash; and the entire ecosystem that will congeal around it &amp;mdash; to spearhead the Japanese giant&#039;s turnaround. The execution will need to be flawless for Sony&#039;s ambitions to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister, Andrew Webster, and Chris Ziegler contributed to this report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;', 1361279082, 1, 1),
